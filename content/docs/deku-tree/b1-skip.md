# B1 Skip
<div class="yt float-right">{{<youtube "kDefCBT0LmE">}}</div>

## Description
A _B1 Skip_ is any way to reach the higher platform in the basement of the _Deku
Tree_ starting from the water as child.  

## Applications
This skips four rooms in B1 including a _Slingshot_-locked room, allowing the
player to reach _Gohma_ without having the _Slingshot_.  
This trick is considered essential in randomizers as it skips an item
requirement and saves a few minutes of going through empty rooms (except for
one _Gold Skulltula_).  

## Setup
### Ground Jump
If you have explosives, you can simply [_Ground Jump_]({{<ref
"/docs/generic/ground-jump">}}) as demonstrated in the [video
example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntgPhH3mhBw). You still need to
perform the _Flame Storage_ described below.

### Flame Storage & Jump
This setup only requires a _Deku Stick_.

1. Perform a _Flame Storage_ with the torch that lights up after stepping on the switch:
   1. Get a _Deku Stick_ out with your `C-Buttons`.
   2. Place Link at the right of the torch, the top of the stick must be
      touching the flame.
   3. Put back the stick in your inventory with `A`.
2. Setup a precise jump to cross the gap:
   1. Get in the obtuse corner near the block of the highest platform.
   2. `Z-Target` the _left_ wall to align yourself.
   3. Ensure you are in the right position by rolling into the corner, if your
      angle and position are right multiple rolls won't change Link's position.
      If you slide right or left when rolling, restart the setup from the
      beginning.
   4. Do in succession two [backflips]({{<relref "todo">}}), one
      [sidehop]({{<relref "todo">}}) to the right, and one sidehop to the left.
   5. `C-Up` and align your `A` button with the pillar coming down from the
      ceiling.

      The black lines starting from the `C-Down` icon and going to the
      bottom-left tells you your position setup is good.
   6. Quit `C-Up`, and [Dry Roll]({{<relref "todo">}}) with `Z`+`A`.
   7. At the same time, go forward and roll with `A`, you should jump and grab
      the ledge. If not, start over.
   8. Go on top of the web, bring your _Deku Stick_ out which will be still
      burning thanks to _Flame Storage_, crouch with `R` and burn the web.
