# _Gohma_ One Cycle
<div class="yt float-right">{{<youtube "XvS6KmYbjw4">}}</div>

## Description
This one-cycle allows you to defeat _Gohma_ in under five seconds.

## Setup
This setup requires two _Deku Sticks_ one of which will be consumed, and one
_Deku Nut_.

1. After getting through the door, perform the [Broken Deku Stick]({{<relref
   "/docs/generic/broken-deku-stick">}}) glitch on a wall.
2. After _Gohma_ drops to the floor, go closer to it and throw a _Deku Nut_
   with your `C-Buttons`
3. [Power Crouch Stab]({{<relref "/docs/generic/power-crouch-stab">}}) once
4. While the animation of the previous attach is still playing, start spamming
   your `C-Buttons` to throw another _Deku Nut_. If you are successful in doing
   so, _Gohma_ will make a sound.
5. Power Crouch Stab twice more.

Three hits are enough to kill _Gohma_, if you fail to hit the second _Deku
Nut_, you may still be able to perform the one cycle but it is inconsistent. If
_Gohma_ starts to get away you may have enough time to throw another _Deku Nut_
and kill before it climbs to the ceiling.
