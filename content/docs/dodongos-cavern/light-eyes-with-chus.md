# Light eyes with chus

## Description
To progress deeper into the dungeon and fight _King Dodongo_, lighting the eyes
in the main room is required and is intended to be done from the top floor
using bombs.  
This trick allow using chus from the ground floor bypassing the entire dungeon.

## Applications
This strat is useful when no bomb bag has been found or if you are doing the
dungeon in _go mode_ and thus have no need to open chests.

## Setup
1. Go in the small corner near the ladder on the right side of the giant head.
2. `Z-Target` the wall to align yourself and keep `Z` pressed.
3. [Backflip]({{<relref "todo">}}).
4. Draw and release your shield with `R`.
5. [Dry Roll]({{<relref "todo">}}).
6. Let go of `Z` and [shield Turn]({{<relref "todo">}}) 90&deg; left, you can
   also flick or `C-Up` if you have no shield.
7. Draw a _Chu_, wait for the apex of the second red phase and [Shield Drop]({{<relref "todo">}}) it.
8. Wait a few seconds to ensure the second _Chu_ won't explode during the
   animation of the first eye lighting.
9. Draw a _Chu_ and immediately drop it using `A`.

If done properly, the second _Chu_ will travel during the first eye animation
and explode immediately after it's done.  
**Do not take the ladder** after dropping the second _Chu_, wait for it to
explode first or **you will softlock**.
