# Broken _Deku Stick_
## Description
_Broken Deku Stick_ is a glitch that allows using a broken _Deku Stick_ after
breaking it, meaning you can indefinitely and [rapidly]({{<relref
"power-crouch-stab">}}) output _Master Sword_ level damage as child without
ever having to obtain the _Kokiri Sword_.  

The glitch occurs when a _Deku Stick_ hits two times in a single jump-slash and
will stay activated until the item in Link's hand is replaced or a Scene
transition occurs. Only one stick will be consumed.  
For the stick to be used, there need to be at least one left in Link's
inventory, meaning you need at least 2 sticks to set the glitch up.

## Applications
This glitch is useful for low%, randomizer, or any category that has to deal
with tight resource management or lacks the _Kokiri Sword_.

## Setup
<div class="yt float-right">{{<youtube "UAZW3MttnmI">}}</div>

### Backflip+Dryroll
This is the easiest and most consistent method.

On a flat surface with an orthogonal wall:

1. Walk to the wall and [Z-Target]({{<relref "todo">}}) to align yourself
   with it
2. [Backflip]({{<relref "todo">}}), let go of your stick after the flip and
   do not touch it again until the setup is completed
3. Draw and release your shield to ensure a forward roll on the next step
4. [Dry Roll]({{<relref "todo">}}) with Z+A
5. Draw your stick using your C-Buttons
6. [Jump-Slash]({{<relref "todo">}}) with Z+A

### 45° angle
On a flat surface with an orthogonal wall:

1. Get your _Deku Stick_ out.
2. Walk to the wall and [Z-Target]({{<relref "todo">}}) to align yourself
   with it
3. Turn 45° to your right, you can either perform an [ESS Turn]({{<relref
   "todo">}}), a [Shield Turn]({{<relref "todo">}}), or eyeball it with a
   flick of your stick.
4. Perform a [forward Jump Slash]({{<relref "todo">}})
