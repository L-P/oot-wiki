<div class="yt float-right">{{<youtube "ntgPhH3mhBw">}}</div>

## Description
_Ground Jumping_ is a technique that allows jumping vertically to climb up
walls you're not supposed to be able to climb normally.  
The glitch can be stored provided you don't perform any kind of jump before using it.

## Applications
This glitch has many applications all over the game, it can allow adult Link to
skip part of the _Sacred Forest Meadow_, child link to perform a [B1
Skip]({{<ref "/docs/deku-tree/b1-skip">}}), and many more.

## Setup
1. Drop a bomb at your feet with a `C-Button` then `A`, you must not
   shield-drop it
2. Take out your sword with `B` and your shield right after with `R`, keep
   your shield up
3. Press `A` to pick up the bomb then hold `Z` right after, this should cancel
   picking up the bomb
4. Wait until the bomb explodes
5. You are now in a glitched state where you can't use items
6. While facing a wall: backflip by targeting with `Z`, flicking your stick down, and pressing `B`
   at the same time

If you accidentally get pushed off a ledge by the recoil, you will need to
perform the setup again, you need to stay on the ground.
